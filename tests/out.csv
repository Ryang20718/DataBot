"They may be very nice bags, but I placed an order 2 weeks ago expecting it to have arrived by now and just learned they're out of stock and my order ""fell through the cracks"". I spoke with Anna the day after I placed the order to get the customization right, and again today when I was informed that they don't have a bag for me (BTW, I had to call them to learn the status). They didn't seem too concerned or apologetic. My card was billed 2 weeks ago, which I'll obviously charge back. The company seems pretty amateur and disorganized. I'm disappointed, but hope the rest of you have a better experience."
"Best.Golf.Bag.Ever. Well-crafted, the customization process was easy and the Customer Support assistance was immediate and wonderful. This isn't even taking into account the humanitarian effort of donating backpacks to kids who need them. I need more stars...5 isn't enough."
"Vessel is an absolutely incredible company. The products are extremely well made, versatile and simply amazing. I also have to say that their CEO, Ronnie Shaw and entire staff (especially Stephanie Beyer!) are extraordinary. Their mission to give one backpack for every bag sold is helping thousands of children, including those who are homeless in San Diego County. I cannot say enough good things about their kindness and generosity. I highly recommend them!!!"
"Thank you to Christian, Ronnie and the team at Vessel for the incredibly quick turnaround and professionalism shown in creating and delivering my client's Tour Bag. We had a very small window of time to have the bag created and delivered to Australia and Vessel were the only company willing and able to do so. The bag was delivered ahead of schedule and I can't recommend this company any higher."
"The VGA bag and logo are awesome, well above my expectations. Many at the driving ranges are asking me how did I get it. Very pleased with the craftsmanship put into making the bag. Excellent marketing tool to promote my association. Thanks Vessel and especially you Stephanie for all the coordination and patience in making it a reality... Look forward to doing business in the future"

"We ordered the Veterans Golf Association golf bag on Monday 3 April 2017 and Fed Ex delivered it mid-morning on Friday 7 April. It is absolutely beautiful with my husband's name embroidered on the front of the bag. The colors and workmanship are great. Christian was very helpful with the order. And, because we were first time buyers, they gave us a 10% discount. Vessel is definitely a caring, American-based company. Thank you from Nampa, Idaho."
"I bought the new VGA bag for a buddy who is a VGA member. He LOVED it! The bag is awesome, the design, color, and makeup of the bag are perfect! Nicely done!"
Vessel Bags are AMAZING! From the very beginning you are guided along in your process with professionals who know their work! Stephanie especially did a very thoroughly job in making sure everything was done correctly. Our expectations were well exceeded when the new bag arrived. Very impressed with the entire process. Thank you so much Vessel Bags!
I am still amazed at the bag I purchased from Vessel. The quality is like nothing I've purchased! The Customer Service is OUTSTANDING!!! Highly recommend this company!!
I just received my new bag and it is flawless. I could have imagined it would look this good. I highly recommend getting your custom bag. Everyone at the gold club loves it...
Great service. The bag is really good. You can really see the quality. All design customizing was as requested. I would definitely recommend.
